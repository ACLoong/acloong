4. Road Map  
    1. os tool module:  
        a. command line arguments tool  
        b. process management tool  
        c. date and time tool

    3. container module  
        a. list, linkedlist and arraylist

        b. byte  
        c. bytes  
        d. decode and encode  
        e. json  
        f. serializer  

     6. utility  
        a. strkit and format  
        b. conf
